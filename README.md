# Slackmoji_Repo
Custom Slackmojis


Step 1: Clone the github repository

Step 2: upload the gifs slack! You can either add them 1-by-1 by clicking "add emoji" in the emoji panel of slack, 
or use this chrome extension for bulk uploads https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neutral-face-emoji-tools/anchoacphlfbdomdlomnbbfhcmcdmjej


------------------------------------------

I also recommend all the party parrots available here: https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/
(best to use the bulk upload tool for those!)


And at risk of giving away my secrets... make your own slackmojis with this: https://makeemoji.com/
It's best to remove the background from any images and makes sure the aspect ratio is square before turning into a fun slackmoji.

A quick tool to remove backgrounds is https://www.remove.bg/


And if you make an AWESOME slackmoji related to astronomy or explanets, create a pull request! I'm happy to merge it into this repo for everyone to use :)
